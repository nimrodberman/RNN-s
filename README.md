# RNN's

This repository has 3 sections:
  1. Vanilla RNN
  2. Vanilla RNN using PyTorch
  3. lvfRNN - Latent Vector Field RNN
  
# Vanilla RNN
in this section, there is a simple Vanilla RNN.
the RNN preforme sentiment classification of sentences.

# PyTorch Vanilla RNN
in this section, there is a simple Vanilla RNN. We implemented the network using PyTorch libraries.
the RNN preforme text generating.

# lvfRNN
In this section, there is a Vanilla RNN with a simple but impactful modification.
The lvfRNN is an implementation of a scientific Paper - Latent Vector Field Recurrent Models. 
In this RNN we calculate a specific matrix for the layer product matrix Whh as the paper suggest.
This section is under work at the moment.
