# RNN's

This repository has 2 sections:
  1. Vanilla RNN
  2. lvfRNN - Latent Vector Field RNN
  
# Vanilla RNN
in this section, there is a simple Vanilla RNN.
Right know the RNN handles Sentiment classification of sentences. In the future there will be more tasks the network will handle.

# lvfRNN
In this section, there is a Vanilla RNN with a simple but impactful modification.
The lvfRNN is an implementation of a scientific Paper - Latent Vector Field Recurrent Models.
